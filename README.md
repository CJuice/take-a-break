# take-a-break
20171003:Taken from John Haney and adapted for shorter intervals between breaks. 

A very simple python program to remind you to take a break!

I (John Haney) set this program up on my work machine with Windows Task Scheduler so once I log in, the program will automatically run every 2 hours. The browser pop-up displays the .gif and reminds me to take a break every once in a while!
